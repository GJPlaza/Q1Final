	<br>

	<img src="Pics/338847.jpg" class="pic">
	<p class="desc">The original trilogy is the first installment of films of the Star Wars saga to be produced. These were the movies released from 1977 to 1983. They primarily focus on the Rebel Alliance trying to free the galaxy from the clutches of the Galactic Empire, as well as Luke Skywalker's quest to become a Jedi and face Sith Lord Darth Vader and his master Darth Sidious. The original trilogy is sometimes called the classic trilogy in contrast to the prequel trilogy. The sequel trilogy takes place 30 years after Return of the Jedi.</p>

		My conclusion of this movie franchise is that it is very solid with an overall score of 95. A New Hope really carried this part of the franchise as it explained what happened to the characters after the prequels even if the prequels were made 30 years before the original trilogy. Although people were not as fond of the Return of the Jedi as in the last two movies, I was able to enjoy it and would watch it again.
