	<h1 class="title">Marvel Phase I</h1>

	<br>

	<img src="Pics/wallpaperflare.com_wallpaper.jpg" class="pic">
	<p class="desc">The first set of movies introduces the main universe in which the films are set, as well as core characters such as Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Nick Fury and War Machine, and organizations such as S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA. Many of the films in Phase One focus on the Tesseract, an extraterrestrial artifact that is later established to contain one of the six Infinity Stones. The final film, The Avengers, involves the villains Loki and Thanos allying to steal the Tesseract and conquer Earth, leading to the formation of the Avengers.</p>

		Marvel Phase I was the start of many movies to come as it showed the backstories of every avenger. In my opinion, it is not really the best phase but it certainly is a good one.
