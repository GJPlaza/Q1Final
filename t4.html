	<h1 class="title">Marvel Phase II</h1>

	<br>

	<img src="Pics/wp4509365-marvel-cinematic-universe-avengers-wallpapers.jpg" class="pic">
	<p class="desc">Phase Two of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is a series of American superhero films produced by Marvel Studios based on characters that appear in publications by Marvel Comics. The phase began in 2013 with the release of Iron Man 3 and concluded in 2015 with the release of Ant-Man. It includes the crossover film Avengers: Age of Ultron, also released in 2015. Kevin Feige produced every film in the phase. The six films of the phase grossed over $5.2 billion at the global box office and received generally positive critical and public response. Chris Evans appeared the most in the phase, starring or making cameo appearances in four of the Phase Two films. Marvel Studios created two more short films for their Marvel One-Shots program to expand the MCU, while each of the feature films received tie-in comic books. Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier also received video game tie-ins, while Lego Marvel's Avengers was also released, which adapted the storyline of multiple films of the franchise. Phase Two, along with Phase One and Phase Three, make up The Infinity Saga.</p>

	I enjoyed watching the second phase of the MCU as it continued the stories of the characters from the last phase. It had gems like winter soldier where it explained what happened to Bucky after the first movie. It also showed new characters from GOTG and Ant-Man
