	<p class="desc">PThe DC Extended Universe (shortened as the DCEU) is an American media franchise and shared universe centered on a series of superhero films and television series produced by DC Films and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. It is based on characters that appear in American comic books published by DC Comics. The DCEU also includes comic books, short films, novels, and video games. Like the original DC Universe in comic books, the DCEU was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters.</p>

	Although the ratings were not very good, I did enjoy watching these movies. I especially liked Justice League because it showed one of my favorite heroes in Flash and showed some other cool ones like Cyborg. What really made me like this are the suits the characters were using because of clean and smooth they all looked.
