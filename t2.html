	<p class="desc">The prequel trilogy is the second installment of films of the Star Wars saga to be produced. They were released from 1999 to 2005. The prequel trilogy describes what had taken place 32 years up to 19 years before the events of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. It primarily focuses on a young Darth Vader, then Jedi Anakin Skywalker, and an accompanying Obi-Wan Kenobi and the story of how they went from being friends to enemies and the tragedy of Anakin's descent into the dark side, as well as the origin of how the Galactic Republic became the Galactic Empire. It also features familiar faces such as C-3PO, R2-D2, Yoda, Chewbacca, and a younger Sheev Palpatine with the story of how he became the Emperor of the galaxy. It was the last trilogy to be distributed by 20th Century Fox until Lucasfilm was acquired by Disney in 2012.</p>

		Although the ratings were not as good as the original trilogy, Revenge Of The Sith is one of the reasons why Star Wars is one of the best franchises. The clone Wars, in my opinion, is also a favorite of mine despite the ratings but the colosseum scene was one the best scenes.
